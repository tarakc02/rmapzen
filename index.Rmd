## Introduction

`rmapzen` is a client for any implementation of the Mapzen API. Though Mapzen itself has [gone out of business](https://mapzen.com/blog/shutdown/), `rmapzen` can be set up to work with any provider who hosts Mapzen's open-source software, including [geocode.earth](https://geocode.earth/), [Nextzen](https://www.nextzen.org/), and [NYC GeoSearch from NYC Planning Labs](https://geosearch.planninglabs.nyc/). For more information, see [https://mapzen.com/documentation/](https://mapzen.com/documentation/). The project is [available on github](https://github.com/tarakc02/rmapzen) as well as [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmapzen). 

`rmapzen` provides access to the following Mapzen API services:

- [Search](https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/): Structured and unstructured search and geocoding, reverse geocoding, and autocomplete. 
- [Vector Tiles](https://mapzen.com/documentation/vector-tiles/): Basemap vector data.
- [Isochrone](https://mapzen.com/documentation/mobility/isochrone/api-reference/): Calculation of areas reachable from a specified locations.

## Installation and Set-up

`rmapzen` is available [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmapzen). To install:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rmapzen")
```

You'll also need to set up options specific to the API provider you end up using. `rmapzen` works with API providers who implement the Mapzen API. In order to specify provider information (such as URL and API key), use `mz_set_host`. There are custom set-up functions for the following providers: 

- [geocode.earth](https://geocode.earth/), for search services. Use the function `mz_set_search_host_geocode.earth`
- [Nextzen](https://www.nextzen.org/), for vector tiles. Use the function `mz_set_tile_host_nextzen`. 
- [NYC GeoSearch](https://geosearch.planninglabs.nyc/), for search services using New York City's Property Address Directory. Use `mz_set_search_host_nyc_geosearch`.

As of this writing, there are no public providers offering the Mapzen isochrone service, but `mz_isochrone` and related functions are available. If you know of a provider not listed here, use the more general `mz_set_host` function, and [submit an issue](https://github.com/tarakc02/rmapzen/issues) so we can create a custom set up function for future users.

## Search

All of the services in [Mapzen search](https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/) have been implemented. Search functions:

* `mz_search`
* `mz_reverse_geocode`
* `mz_autocomplete`
* `mz_place`
* `mz_structured_search` ([what's this?](https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/structured-geocoding/))

For example, to search for public library branches in Oakland, CA:

```{r loadmapzen, warning = FALSE}
# load rmapzen and run provider set-up functions
library(rmapzen)
mz_set_tile_host_nextzen()
mz_set_search_host_geocode.earth()
```

```{r ex-search-2, cache = TRUE}
oakland_public <- mz_search("Oakland Public Library Branch", 
                            size = 20, focus.point = mz_geocode("Oakland, CA"))
oakland_public
```

Search can, optionally, be constrained to a particular country, data layer, boundary rectangle, or boundary circle. Furthermore, search can prioritize results near a given "focus" point. See `?mz_search`.

Additionally, `mz_geocode` is a convenient function to geocode an address, utilizing the more general `mz_search` function.

```{r ex-geocode, cache = TRUE}
mz_geocode("UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA")
```

## Vector tile service

`rmapzen` provides an interface to Mapzen's [vector tiles service](https://mapzen.com/documentation/vector-tiles/). Tile requests can be specified using the x, y, zoom coordinates of the tile service, as well as with a lat/long bounding box. For instance, continuing the previous example:

```{r vector-tile-example, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, dpi = 300}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)

# mz_bbox is a generic that returns the bounding box of an object
oakland_tiles <- mz_vector_tiles(mz_bbox(oakland_public))

# vector tiles return all layers (roads, water, buildings, etc) in a list
roads <- as_sf(oakland_tiles$roads) %>% 
    filter(kind != "ferry")
water <- as_sf(oakland_tiles$water)

labels <- as.data.frame(oakland_public) %>% 
    mutate(name = str_replace_all(
        name, 
        "(Oakland Public Library)|(Branch)", ""))

# make a quick static map that includes roads and oceans as reference
ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = water, 
            fill = "lightblue", colour = NA) + 
    geom_sf(data = roads, 
            size = .2, colour = "gray30") + 
    geom_sf(data = as_sf(oakland_public), 
            colour = "black", size = 1) + 
    ggrepel::geom_label_repel(
        data = labels,
        aes(x = lon, y = lat, label = name), size = 3,
        family = "Roboto Condensed", label.padding = unit(.1, "lines"),
        alpha = .7) +
    theme_void() + 
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0))
```

## `sf` and `Spatial*DataFrame` conversion

As some of the above examples illustrate, any object returned by a Mapzen service can be converted to the appropriate `Spatial*DataFrame` or `sf` object using the generics `as_sp` and `as_sf`, for easy interoperability with other packages. You can also convert most objects directly to data frames, allowing for use within tidy pipelines:

```{r ex-tidy, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
as.data.frame(oakland_public) %>%
    select(name, confidence, region, locality, neighbourhood)
```

## Accessor methods

Currently, the following methods are available to pull out commonly used 
pieces of a response:

* `mz_coordinates` (only available for search results): extracts lat/lon coordinates from search results, and returns them as a `data.frame`.
* `mz_bbox`: returns the bounding box of an object as a `data.frame` with columns `min_lon`, `min_lat`, `max_lon`, and `max_lat`.

```{r ex-accessors, cache = TRUE}
mz_coordinates(oakland_public)
mz_bbox(oakland_tiles)
```

## Convenience features

Several of the search functions take, optionally, the arguments `layers`, `sources`, and `boundary.country` (the latter requires [ISO-3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166) codes). If you're using an IDE with auto-complete, the objects `mz_layers`, `mz_sources`, and `mz_countries` should make it easier to get the correct codes.

Similarly, argument constructors are available for easier specifications of isochrone and search requests.

* `mz_costing` 
* `mz_costing_options` 
* `mz_location`
* `mz_contours`
* `mz_date_time`

## Related projects

The package does not yet support [other Mapzen API services](https://mapzen.com/documentation/). But do check out these related R packages:

* [elevatr](https://github.com/jhollist/elevatr) for accessing elevation data, including Mapzen Terrain and Elevation
* [postr](https://github.com/Ironholds/poster) for address parsing and normalization using the [libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal) library
